My perfect Django sandbox, but with some nice functionality for myself :3

# Welcome my friends!
It's so nice to see you here :)

This project is not going to something outstanding, but here i want to test all my knollege about web development.
For today my list of stuff i am going to implement or just use in this project:

1. Django (also need find some best practices)
2. Bootstrap (why not? I don't have that much time :"( )
3. Celery + Redis (for some file uploads? But i just need to test it out :D )
4. PostgreSQL (as main DB, also find need to find some nice usage for this DB)
5. ElasticSearch (for full-text search... yeah.. that's it)
